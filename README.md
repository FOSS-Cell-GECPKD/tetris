[Play Tetris](https://foss-cell-gecpkd.github.io/tetris/)

## Rules

Tetris has very simple rules: you can only move the pieces in specific ways; your game is over if your pieces reach the top of the screen; 
and you can only remove pieces from the screen by filling all the blank space in a line.
Your objective is to get all the blocks to fill all the empty space in a line at the bottom of the screen; 
whenever you do this, youâ€™ll find that the blocks vanish and you get awarded some points.
